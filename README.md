# How to Setup Project / How to run tests

``` 
1) Ideally, download IntelliJ Idea - it has a free 30-day evaluation phase. All default install settings are fine.
2) Clone Repo
3) Configure Your JDK if you haven't for IntelliJ, in this project I used JDK 9 but I think any recent JDK should be fine.
4) Open the project in IntelliJ
    - Once the project is opened, IntelliJ should do all the work.
    - If that is not the case, there should be a message that pops up at the bottom of the screen. saying Import Changes or it gives you the option Enable Auto Import, either will work.
    - Give IntelliJ some time to load/index and pull in dependencies, it really depends on how fast your pc setup is.
5) Navigate to "VendingMachineTest" class, right click on it and click Run 'VendingMachineTest'
    - You should see the success message saying "All 33 tests passed".
